CodeNut streamlines smart contract deployment with automatic devnet deployment for testing and seamless mainnet deployment for production. This guide covers the entire deployment workflow from development to production.

## Smart Contract Development Workflow

### 1. AI Contract Generation
Simply describe what you want to build and CodeNut's AI will handle everything:

```
"Create an ERC-721 NFT contract with minting functionality"
"Build a DeFi yield farming contract with staking rewards"
"Make a simple voting contract for DAO governance"
```

**What happens automatically:**
- AI generates complete Solidity contract code
- Follows security best practices and standards
- Includes comprehensive comments and documentation
- Compiles automatically with optimized settings
- Deploys instantly to CodeNut Devnet
- Contract address and details displayed in chat

### 2. Automatic Devnet Deployment
Every smart contract is automatically deployed to CodeNut's development network:
- **Instant Deployment**: No waiting, no setup required
- **Zero Cost**: No gas fees for devnet deployment
- **No Signing**: Contracts deploy without wallet interaction
- **Immediate Testing**: Start interacting with your contract right away

## Contract Information & Metadata

### Deployment Information
After your contract is generated and deployed to devnet, you'll see:
- **Contract Address**: Your devnet contract address
- **Transaction Hash**: Deployment transaction details
- **Network Info**: CodeNut Devnet details
- **ABI**: Application Binary Interface for frontend integration

### Metadata Storage
All deployment information is automatically saved to your project:
```json
// contracts/metadata.json
{
  "devnet": {
    "MyNFTContract": {
      "address": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "deploymentTx": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
      "abi": [...],
      "deployedAt": "2024-08-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend Integration
The AI automatically uses this metadata to:
- Connect your frontend to the deployed contracts
- Generate appropriate contract interaction code
- Handle contract calls and transactions
- Update frontend logic when contracts change

## Testing Your Smart Contracts

### Interactive Testing on Devnet
The best way to test your smart contracts is by using your DApp:

**Through the Preview Interface:**
- **Real User Testing**: Interact with your DApp as users would
- **Instant Feedback**: See results immediately on devnet
- **Easy Debugging**: Ask the AI to fix issues you discover
- **Unlimited Resources**: Use the devnet faucet for testing assets

**Example Testing Flow:**
```
You: "Test the NFT minting function"
→ Use the preview interface to mint NFTs
→ Check if metadata displays correctly
→ Test different wallet interactions

You: "The minting seems to fail with large quantities"
AI: Analyzes the issue and fixes the contract
→ Redeploys automatically to devnet
→ You test again with the fix
```

### What to Test
- **Core Functionality**: All main features of your contract
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios  
- **User Workflows**: Complete user journeys through your DApp
- **Integration**: How contracts work together in your system

## Mainnet Deployment

### Supported EVM-Compatible Networks
When you're ready for production, deploy to these mainnets:

#### **Layer 1 Networks**
- **Ethereum**: The original and most secure smart contract platform
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: High throughput with low fees
- **Avalanche**: High-performance blockchain with fast finality

#### **Layer 2 Networks**  
- **Polygon**: Low-cost Ethereum Layer 2 solution
- **Arbitrum**: Ethereum Layer 2 with full EVM compatibility
- **Optimism**: Optimistic rollup scaling solution
- **Base**: Coinbase's Layer 2 network built on Optimism

### Choosing the Right Network
**Consider these factors:**
- **Gas Costs**: Layer 2s typically have much lower fees
- **Security**: Ethereum mainnet offers the highest security
- **Speed**: Layer 2s provide faster transaction confirmation
- **Ecosystem**: Choose networks where your users are active
- **Liquidity**: Consider available tokens and DeFi protocols

## Mainnet Deployment Process

### 1. Development & Testing (Devnet)
This happens automatically when you create contracts:
- AI generates and deploys contracts to devnet instantly
- Test thoroughly using the preview interface
- Iterate and fix issues with AI assistance
- Use devnet faucet for unlimited testing assets

### 2. Ready for Production
When you're satisfied with your devnet testing, use the Publish dialog to deploy:

1. **Click the Publish Button**: Located in the top toolbar (rocket icon)
2. **Open Publish Dialog**: A dialog opens showing two main options:
   - Website Publishing (for your frontend)
   - Contract Deployment (for mainnet deployment)

### 3. Contract Deployment Process
**Using the Contract Deploy Card:**

1. **Select Target Network**: Choose from supported mainnets:
   - Ethereum Mainnet
   - Polygon 
   - Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
   - Arbitrum
   - Base
   - Other EVM-compatible networks

2. **Review Deployment Details**: 
   - See which contracts will be deployed
   - Review gas cost estimates
   - Verify deployment settings

3. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your wallet is connected and has sufficient funds

4. **Deploy Contracts**: Click deploy to initiate the process
   - Sign the deployment transaction in your wallet
   - Pay the required gas fees
   - Wait for deployment confirmation

5. **Verification**: Contracts are automatically verified on the selected network's block explorer

## After Mainnet Deployment

### Updated Project Configuration
Once deployed to mainnet, your project automatically updates:
- **Metadata Updated**: `contracts/metadata.json` includes mainnet addresses
- **Frontend Integration**: Published DApp uses mainnet contract addresses
- **Dual Environment**: Preview continues using devnet, published version uses mainnet

### Contract Verification
Your contracts are automatically verified on blockchain explorers:
- **Etherscan**: For Ethereum mainnet deployments
- **Polygonscan**: For Polygon network deployments  
- **Arbiscan**: For Arbitrum network deployments
- **BSCScan**: For Binance Smart Chain deployments

**Benefits of verification:**
- Users can read your contract source code
- Builds trust and transparency
- Enables better integration with other tools
- Provides better debugging capabilities

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet, ensure you've:

### ✅ Devnet Testing Complete
- [ ] Contract functions work as expected in preview
- [ ] All user workflows tested thoroughly
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions handled
- [ ] Integration with other contracts verified

### ✅ Security & Quality
- [ ] AI security analysis reviewed
- [ ] No obvious vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Contract follows best practices
- [ ] Consider manual audit for high-value contracts

### ✅ Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Target network selected (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- [ ] Wallet connected with sufficient funds for gas
- [ ] Gas costs estimated and acceptable
- [ ] Ready to sign deployment transaction

## Best Practices

### 1. Thorough Devnet Testing
Always test extensively on CodeNut Devnet before mainnet:
- Test every function and feature
- Try different user scenarios
- Use the devnet faucet to test with various token amounts
- Ask the AI to help identify potential issues

### 2. Network Selection Strategy
Choose your deployment network based on:
- **Cost vs Security**: Ethereum is most secure but expensive
- **User Base**: Where are your target users?
- **Ecosystem**: What protocols and tokens do you need?
- **Performance**: Layer 2s offer faster, cheaper transactions

### 3. Post-Deployment
After successful mainnet deployment:
- Verify your contract is working on the live network
- Test key functions with small amounts first
- Monitor for any unusual activity
- Consider setting up alerts for important events

### 4. Documentation
- Keep your contract source code and documentation updated
- Explain key functions and their purpose
- Document any administrative functions or emergency procedures
- Share deployment addresses with your team

## Getting Started

Ready to deploy your smart contracts? The process is simple:
