---

CodeNut is an AI-powered Web3 development platform that helps you build full-stack decentralized applications. This guide will walk you through the basics of using CodeNut to create your first DApp.

## Creating Your First Project

### 1. Sign Up and Authentication

CodeNut supports multiple authentication methods:
- **OAuth Login**: Sign in with Google or GitHub for quick access
- **Web3 Wallets**: Connect with MetaMask and other wallets powered by REOWN (formerly WalletConnect) using Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)

### 2. Starting a New Project

You can start building your DApp in two ways:
1. **From the Home Page**: Simply type your project requirements directly in the input field on the home page
2. **From a Project**: Click the "New Project" button in the sidebar if you're already in a project

The AI will automatically:
- Generate an appropriate project name and description
- Set up the optimal project structure for your needs
- Configure all necessary dependencies

### 3. AI Chat Interface

The heart of CodeNut is the AI chat interface where you interact with specialized agents:

- **Type your requests**: Describe what you want to build in natural language
- **Real-time responses**: See AI responses stream in real-time
- **Context awareness**: The AI remembers your project context and previous conversations
- **Tool execution**: Watch as the AI uses tools to edit files, run commands, and more

## Working with AI Agents

CodeNut uses specialized AI agents for different tasks:

### 🤖 General Agent
- Code generation and editing
- Project setup and configuration
- General development assistance

### 🔐 Security Agent
- Code security analysis
- Smart contract vulnerability detection
- Best practices enforcement

### 💎 Crypto Expert
- Blockchain-specific development
- Smart contract creation
- Web3 integration guidance

### 🎨 UI Developer
- Frontend design and styling
- Component creation
- User interface optimization

### 🐛 Debug Agent
- Error diagnosis and fixing
- Performance optimization
- Testing assistance

## Project Structure

CodeNut projects follow standard Web3 development patterns:

```
your-project/
├── src/                 # Frontend source code
│   ├── components/     # React components
│   ├── pages/         # Page components
│   ├── contracts/     # Smart contract interfaces
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
├── contracts/          # Smart contract source
├── public/            # Static assets
└── package.json       # Dependencies
```

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Describe Your Vision
Start by describing what you want to build:
> "I want to create a NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, and sell digital art"

### 2. Let AI Build the Foundation
The AI will:
- Set up the project structure
- Install necessary dependencies
- Create initial smart contracts
- Build the frontend interface

### 3. Iterate and Refine
Continue the conversation to refine your DApp:
> "Add a feature to display trending NFTs on the homepage"
> "Implement a bidding system for auctions"
> "Add wallet connection with MetaMask support"

### 4. Preview and Test
- Use the built-in preview to see your DApp in action
- Test smart contract interactions
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## Key Features to Explore

### Real-time Code Editor
- Syntax highlighting for Solidity, JavaScript, and TypeScript
- Auto-completion and error detection
- Git integration with diff views

### Smart Contract Tools
- Solidity contract creation and compilation
- Deployment to multiple EVM-compatible networks
- Contract verification and interaction

### Web3 Integration
- Wallet connection components
- Blockchain interaction utilities
- EVM-compatible chain support

### Publishing Options
- One-click deployment to hosting platforms
- Custom domain configuration
- Smart contract deployment to mainnet (Ethereum, BSC, Base, Arbitrum, etc.)

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your requests, the better the AI can help
2. **Iterate Gradually**: Build your DApp step by step rather than all at once
3. **Test Early**: Use the preview feature to test functionality as you build
4. **Ask Questions**: The AI can explain code and provide learning opportunities
5. **Explore Examples**: Try asking for popular DApp patterns and templates

## Next Steps
