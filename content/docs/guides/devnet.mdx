CodeNut Devnet is a specialized development blockchain designed to streamline smart contract development and testing. It provides a frictionless development experience with zero setup required and automatic contract deployment.

## What is CodeNut Devnet?

CodeNut Devnet is a hosted development blockchain that serves as your primary testing environment. Here's what makes it special:

### üåê Ethereum Mainnet Fork
- **Real-world Data**: Fork of Ethereum mainnet as of August 2025
- **Familiar Environment**: Contains all common smart contracts and tokens from Ethereum
- **Realistic Testing**: Test against actual DeFi protocols, NFT collections, and other mainnet contracts

### ‚ö° Zero Setup Required  
- **Default Network**: Automatically used for all development work
- **No Configuration**: No network setup, RPC configuration, or wallet connections needed
- **Instant Access**: Start building immediately without any preliminary steps

### ü§ñ Automatic Deployment
- **AI-Powered**: Smart contracts generated by AI are automatically compiled and deployed
- **No Signing Required**: No wallet signatures or user interaction needed during development
- **Instant Deployment**: Contracts are deployed immediately as they're created

## How CodeNut Devnet Works

### Automatic Contract Deployment
When you ask the AI to create smart contracts, here's what happens automatically:

1. **Contract Generation**: AI writes your smart contract code
2. **Auto Compilation**: Contract is compiled automatically with optimized settings  
3. **Instant Deployment**: Contract deploys to devnet without user interaction
4. **Address Display**: Contract address and network info appear in the chat
5. **Metadata Storage**: Deployment info is saved to `contracts/metadata.json`

### Contract Information Display
After deployment, you'll see:
- Contract address on devnet
- Network information and chain ID
- Transaction hash for the deployment
- ABI and other contract details

### Metadata Management
All deployment information is automatically stored in your project:
```json
// contracts/metadata.json
{
  "devnet": {
    "MyContract": {
      "address": "0x1234...",
      "deploymentTx": "0xabcd...",
      "abi": [...],
      "deployedAt": "2024-08-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Assets on Devnet

### Built-in Devnet Faucet
CodeNut Devnet includes an integrated faucet for all your testing needs:

#### How to Access the Faucet
- **Location**: Upper right corner of the preview UI
- **Easy Access**: Click the faucet button when testing your DApp
- **No External Sites**: Everything happens within CodeNut

#### Available Assets
Claim any assets you need for testing:
- **ETH**: For gas fees and transactions
- **USDT**: Tether stablecoin for DeFi testing
- **USDC**: USD Coin for financial applications  
- **Common Tokens**: Any popular ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum mainnet
- **Custom Tokens**: Tokens specific to your DApp testing needs

#### How to Claim Assets

- Open the DevNet Faucet dialog
- Select one of the tokens
- For custom token, you need to provide the token address
- Provide the amount to claim, there will be some daily upper limit for the amount depending on the type of the token.

## Development Workflow with CodeNut Devnet

### 1. Development Phase (Devnet)
All development work happens automatically on devnet:

```
"Create an NFT marketplace smart contract"
"Build a DeFi staking protocol"
"Make a DAO governance system"
```

**What happens automatically:**
- Smart contract is written by AI
- Contract compiles automatically
- Deploys instantly to devnet
- Contract address displayed in chat
- Frontend connects to devnet contract
- Test with unlimited devnet assets

### 2. Testing Phase (Devnet)
Test your DApp thoroughly on devnet by interacting with the dApp and smart contract.

**Testing Benefits:**
- **Instant Transactions**: No waiting for block confirmations
- **Free Assets**: Claim unlimited tokens for testing
- **Real Mainnet Data**: Test against actual Ethereum protocols
- **Risk-Free**: No real money involved

### 3. Production Deployment (Mainnet)
When ready, deploy to production using the publish dialog.

**Deployment Process:**
- Choose your target mainnet (ETH, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Review gas estimation before deployment
- Sign transaction with your wallet
- Pay gas fees for deployment
- Contract deploys to selected mainnet
- Published DApp uses mainnet addresses

## Preview vs Published DApp

### Preview Mode (Uses Devnet)
When you're developing and testing:
- **Preview URL**: Your DApp preview always uses devnet contracts
- **Fast Testing**: Instant transactions and free assets
- **Safe Environment**: No real money, unlimited experimentation
- **Devnet Contracts**: All interactions use devnet-deployed contracts

### Published DApp (Uses Mainnet)
When you publish your DApp:
- **Production Ready**: Published DApp uses mainnet contracts
- **Real Transactions**: Users interact with real blockchain
- **Custom Domain**: Available on your .codenut.xyz subdomain or custom domain
- **Mainnet Addresses**: Automatically switches to mainnet contract addresses

### Dual Environment Benefits
- **Seamless Development**: Build and test without any blockchain complexity
- **Easy Deployment**: One command moves from devnet to mainnet
- **Safe Testing**: Always test on devnet before mainnet deployment
- **Cost Effective**: No gas fees during development phase

## Devnet vs Traditional Testnets

### CodeNut Devnet Advantages
**Compared to traditional testnets like Sepolia or Mumbai:**

#### Zero Friction Development
- **No Setup**: Works immediately without any configuration
- **No Faucets**: Built-in assets, no external faucet websites
- **No Wallet Signing**: Automatic deployment without user interaction
- **No Gas Fees**: All development operations are free

#### Better Development Experience  
- **Instant Deployment**: Contracts deploy immediately
- **Real Data**: Fork of actual Ethereum mainnet with real protocols
- **Unlimited Assets**: Get any amount of any token for testing
- **Always Available**: No network downtime or congestion

#### Streamlined Workflow
- **Automatic**: Everything happens without user intervention
- **Integrated**: Faucet and deployment built into the interface
- **Persistent**: Your contracts stay deployed for extended testing
- **Metadata Tracking**: All deployment info automatically saved

## Best Practices with CodeNut Devnet

### Development Best Practices

#### 1. Thorough Devnet Testing
- **Test All Features**: Ensure every function works on devnet first
- **Edge Case Testing**: Try extreme values and error conditions
- **User Flow Testing**: Test complete user journeys on devnet
- **Integration Testing**: Test how contracts interact with each other

#### 2. Asset Management
