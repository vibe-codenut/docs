After deploying your smart contracts to mainnet, you can publish your DApp's frontend to make it live for users. CodeNut provides powerful website publishing with built-in performance optimization and domain management.

**Important**: You must deploy your smart contracts to a mainnet blockchain before publishing your DApp. The publishing process creates the production version of your frontend that connects to your deployed contracts.
