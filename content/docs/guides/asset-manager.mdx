The Asset Manager is a powerful visual content creation and management system that allows you to generate, organize, and manage AI-generated images through conversational interactions.

## Overview

The Asset Manager consists of two main sections:
- **[Asset Generation Studio](https://codenut.ai/assets-generate/create)**  - Interactive workspace for creating images through AI conversations
- **[Asset Library](https://codenut.ai/assets-generate)** - Gallery view for managing your generated assets

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Asset Manager

Navigate to the Asset Manager from the main navigation or sidebar,  or visit `/assets-generate` directly. You'll see:

1. **Create Visuals Input** - Main prompt interface for generating new images
2. **Recent Conversations** - Quick access to your recent generation sessions
3. **Asset Library** - Grid view of all your generated images

## Creating Images

### Basic Image Generation

1. **Enter a Prompt**: Describe the image you want to generate in the main input field
   - Example: "A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"
   - Be descriptive and specific for better results

2. **Submit**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` or click the send button to start generation

3. **AI Processing**: The system uses advanced AI models to create your image based on your description

### Advanced Features

#### Image-to-Image Generation
- **Upload Reference Images**: Click the photo upload button to add reference images
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use previously generated images as starting points for new variations
- **File Support**: Accepts common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 5MB per uploaded image

#### Conversation-Based Workflow
- **Session Management**: Each generation session maintains context and history
- **Iterative Improvements**: Refine images through follow-up prompts
- **Auto-Generated Titles**: Sessions are automatically titled based on your initial prompt

> [!TIP]
> When the generated image is ready, don't forget to add it to the assets so you can use it in your projects.

## Using Assets in Projects

Once you've generated and saved assets to your library, you can easily integrate them into your coding projects through the chat interface.

### Accessing the Asset Library from Projects

![Asset Selection](/images/asset-selection-button.png)

1. **Open Project Chat**: Navigate to any of your coding projects
2. **Asset Selection Button**: Look for the asset/image icon in the chat input toolbar
3. **Browse Your Library**: Click to open the asset selection modal

### Asset Selection Modal

The asset selection modal provides a streamlined interface for choosing assets:

**Selection Process:**
1. Click on assets to select/deselect them (selected assets show a blue ring)
2. Use the counter to track your selections (e.g., "Select 2 Assets")
3. Click "Select" to add chosen assets to your message
4. Selected assets appear as thumbnails in the chat input area

### Sending Messages with Assets

**Asset Attachment Process:**
1. **Select Assets**: Choose up to 3 assets from your library
2. **Write Your Message**: Describe what you want the AI to do with the assets
3. **Send**: Assets are automatically attached to your message
4. **AI Processing**: The AI can analyze, modify, or use your assets as reference

**What You Can Do with Assets:**
- **Visual Reference**: "Use this design as inspiration for the homepage"
- **Code Generation**: "Create CSS to replicate this layout"
- **Analysis**: "What colors are used in this image?"
- **Modification Requests**: "Make a version of this with a dark theme"
- **Integration**: "Add this logo to the header component"

### Best Practices for Project Integration

**Effective Asset Usage:**
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want the AI to do with each asset
2. **Provide Context**: Explain how the asset relates to your project
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Generate assets with clear, descriptive prompts for easier identification
4. **Organize by Project**: Consider creating assets specifically for each project's needs

**Message Examples:**
- "Using this mockup [asset], create the React component with Tailwind CSS"
- "Analyze the color scheme in this design [asset] and create CSS variables"
- "This is our brand logo [asset], please add it to the navigation component"
- "Based on this UI pattern [asset], implement a similar card layout"

## Asset Library Management

You can manage all the generated and uploaded asset in the [Asset Library](https://codenut.ai/assets-generate)

### Asset Operations

#### Individual Asset Actions
Each asset card provides several options:

1. **Edit**: Return to the generation session where the image was created
2. **Download**: Save the image to your device
3. **Delete**: Remove the asset permanently (with confirmation dialog)

#### Bulk Operations
Select multiple assets (up to 10) for batch operations:

- **Multi-Select**: Click assets to select/deselect them
- **Bulk Download**: Download selected assets as a ZIP file
- **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple assets at once
- **Selection Limit**: Maximum 10 assets can be selected simultaneously

#### Upload Assets
- **Manual Upload**: Add existing images to your asset library
- **Drag & Drop**: (If supported) Drop files directly into the interface
- **File Validation**: Automatic validation of file types and sizes

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
1. **Be Specific**: Include details about style, colors, composition
2. **Use Descriptive Language**: Rich adjectives help the AI understand your vision
3. **Specify Art Styles**: Mention specific artistic styles or techniques
4. **Include Context**: Describe the setting, mood, or atmosphere

### Managing Your Assets
1. **Regular Organization**: Delete unused assets to keep your library clean
2. **Descriptive Sessions**: Use meaningful prompts that will generate good auto-titles
3. **Backup Important Assets**: Download critical images for local backup
4. **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Use the conversation system to refine images progressively

### Workflow Tips
1. **Start Broad, Then Refine**: Begin with general concepts, then add specific details
2. **Use Reference Images**: Upload examples of styles or compositions you like
3. **Experiment with Variations**: Try different phrasings of the same concept
4. **Save Intermediate Results**: Add promising variations to your asset library
