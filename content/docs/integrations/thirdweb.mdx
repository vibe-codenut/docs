title: Use Thirdweb Contracts in CodeNut
description: Connect and interact with Thirdweb-deployed contracts within CodeNut projects
---

This guide explains how to use smart contracts that were deployed via Thirdweb directly inside CodeNut. You can read and write to those contracts from your CodeNut-generated dApps and agents.

## Prerequisites

- A contract deployed on Thirdweb (any EVM chain)

## Just vibe coding

In CodeNut, you don't need to hand-write integration code. Simply describe your needs, and the platform will generate a complete website and wire up the contract automatically.

Example prompt (paste into the chat):

```text
I have created an NFT contract:
https://thirdweb.com/base-sepolia-testnet/0xCa52BB6E304c66Dd8Fa78De22B48aCA38d192900

Please create an NFT website that:

Displays and sells each NFT from the contract.

Fetches the price, supply, and attributes of each NFT directly from the contract.

Provides a purchase button for each NFT.

Uses a black and gold color scheme to make the website visually appealing.
```

After a few minutes, you'll receive a working site link (like `https://thirdweb-demo.codenut.xyz/`).

From there, you can iterate entirely with natural language â€” tweak layout and copy, adjust colors/typography, add sections and media, change how NFTs are fetched and displayed (price, supply, attributes), wire up purchase flows, connect other chains, or switch themes. Just describe what you want, and CodeNut will update the site accordingly.

Finally, click Publish in the top-right to deploy with one click. You and your friends can then access it easily.
