title: Use Thirdweb Contracts in CodeNut
description: Connect and interact with Thirdweb-deployed contracts within CodeNut projects
---

This guide explains how to use smart contracts that were deployed via Thirdweb directly inside CodeNut. You can read and write to those contracts from your CodeNut-generated dApps and agents.

## Prerequisites

- A contract deployed on Thirdweb (any EVM chain)
- The contract address and deployed chain ID
- ABI of the contract (downloaded from Thirdweb or your build artifacts)

## Just vibe coding

在 CodeNut 中，你无需手写集成代码，只需描述你的需求，平台会自动生成完整站点并接好合约。

示例输入（复制粘贴到对话框）：

```text
I have created an NFT contract:
https://thirdweb.com/base-sepolia-testnet/0xCa52BB6E304c66Dd8Fa78De22B48aCA38d192900

Please create an NFT website that:

Displays and sells each NFT from the contract.

Fetches the price, supply, and attributes of each NFT directly from the contract.

Provides a purchase button for each NFT.

Uses a black and gold color scheme to make the website visually appealing.
```

几分钟后，你会得到一个可用的站点链接（例如 `http://xxxxx`）。

最后，点击右上角的 “Publish”，即可一键发布；你和你的朋友都可以轻松访问。
